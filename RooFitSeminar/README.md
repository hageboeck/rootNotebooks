## FitCMSDataset.ipynb
Fit the Z peak in the above dataset using a Bukin function and a background model of Bernstein polynomials.

## HiggsCombinationDemo.ipynb
Show how to combine two likelihood functions that have been saved into files. This uses very simple toy models, but it shows how a large combination of measurements can work in principle.
