## Bernstein + Gauss example
Notebook showing how RooFit's batch computation feature can speed up fits in ROOT 6.24.

## BinSamplingPdf
Notebook showing how to reduce the bias in binned fits that occurs when a PDF is strongly curved in a bin. Needs ROOT 6.24.

## Recovery from invalid parameters
Notebook showing two fits using an unstable fit model. Starting from ROOT 6.24, the fitter can recover from instabilities.
